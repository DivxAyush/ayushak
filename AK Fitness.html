  <b>If you’re dreaming of lean and muscular physic, then make sure your workout includes exercises to build muscle.
    Despite what many women think, building muscle doesn’t automatically make you look big and bulky. Strength training
    is key to looking strong and toned. It can also help you burn fat and lose weight in the long run.</b>

  <b>if you’re looking for exercises to build muscle that doesn’t require any equipment, then push-ups are the way to
    go. While they mainly work your
    upper body (triceps, pectoral muscles, and shoulders), push-ups can also strengthen your core and lower back. Start
    with 5 or 10 each morning. Then,
    slowly add more every couple of days to build up your strength and endurance.

    If a full push-up is too difficult, you can also modify the pose to make things easier. Rest your hands on a higher
    surface or do a push-up on your knees instead.</b>

  <b>It’s no secret that protein is a key portion of a plan when trying to build muscle. Protein is full of amino acids,
    which are the building blocks of protein, and help to repair and maintain muscle tissue. And you can find tons of
    protein in most meat options. A specific type of meat that is really great for protein is steak and beef, as animal
    tissue has tons of protein and nutrients.

    So if you’re looking to build muscle, you’ll definitely need a steady source of protein. By far our favorite meat
    supplier is Omaha Steaks, the quality of their meat is great and they have tons of options, including seafood as
    well! Also buying in bulk is a great way to help you reduce your food budget while getting all the protein you need,
    and it gets delivered straight to your doorstep.</b>
